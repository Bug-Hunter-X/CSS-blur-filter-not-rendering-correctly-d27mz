# CSS blur filter not working

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `filter: blur()` property where the blur effect is not correctly applied to an element. The bug.css file contains the buggy CSS code, while solution.css provides the corrected version.

## Bug Description

An element is styled to have a blur effect using `filter: blur()`, but the effect is not visible, or the blur radius seems incorrect. This can be due to several reasons, including improper use of the filter property, conflicting styles, or issues with rendering context.
